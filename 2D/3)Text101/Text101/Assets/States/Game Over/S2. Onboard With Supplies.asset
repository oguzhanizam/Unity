  storyText: "You take what feels like an eternity to scrounge a rock flinger and
    3 vials of tonix. When a huge machine cog lands an arm span from your head you
    decide its time to make your dash.\r\n\r\nYou scramble aboard your airship. With
    all of your remaining strength, you lift the anchoring rope off its huge hook
    and give an all mighty shove.\r\n\r\nFrom behind you hear a surprised crew member.

    For now.\r\n\r\n1. Continue..."
